# Project Description

in this project after connecting to Alibaba Cloud and using its commands, we created a script that is used to create ecs instances easier and faster than using Alibaba Cloud website, where you can create more than one instance at a time with the same specifications.

# How it works
firstly, you should replace (Region_Id, Image_Id, Security_GroupId, VSwitch_Id)you will find it in the top of the script 

in export Alibaba cloud cli line, you should replace <Alibaba cloud cli folder name> <your acess key> <your acess key secret>  


after running the script file it will ask user how many instances you want to create, and to set passwords for it
